MTA Lab

Objective:

Apply your knowledge of JavaScript to solve a problem we've already tackled in Ruby.

Create a program that models a simple subway system.

The program takes the line and stop that a user is getting on at and the line and stop that user is getting off at and prints the total number of stops for the trip.

There are 3 subway lines:
The N line has the following stops: Times Square, 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and 8th
The L line has the following stops: 8th, 6th, Union Square, 3rd, and 1st
The 6 line has the following stops: Grand Central, 33rd, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and Astor Place.
All 3 subway lines intersect at Union Square, but there are no other intersection points. (For example, this means the 28th stop on the N line is different than the 28th street stop on the 6 line, so you'll have to differentiate this when you name your stops in the arrays.)
Tell the user the number of stops AND the stops IN ORDER that they will pass through or change at.
Hints:

Get the program to work for a single line before trying to tackle multiple lines.
Don't worry about user input. Start off by just hardcoding your stop and line choices in local variables.
If you want to add user input, use prompt('Some prompt') to read from the user.
Remember, you've done this in Ruby before. Look at your code and figure out how to do it in JavaScript.
Consider diagraming the lines by sketching out the subway lines and their stops and intersection.
Make subway lines keys in a hash, while the values are an array of all the stops on each line.
The key to the lab is finding the index positions of each stop.
Make sure the stops that are the same for different lines have different names (i.e. 23rd on the N and on the 6 need to be differentiated)
